# List of Edits to the treebank

On Jul 10 2019, I have uploaded a new XML version on Arethusa, with improved
tokenization (krasis of καί and the 5 complex conjunctions).

Progress:

* prune useless Artificial Nodes

* checking doubtful construction:
    * proleptic pronouns
    * advs with ἔχειν

* checking doubtful POS tags:
    * σός > Pron (not adj)
    * τε : conj
    * μηδέ: conj
    * οὐδέ: conj
    * οὔτε: conj
    * μήτε: conj
    * εἴτε: conj
    * ἄν: AuxY > adv (lemma=ἄν1) ; AuxC > conj (lemma=ἐάν)

* ~~checking the `UNDEFINED` relations~~

* ~~checking the wrong `_ExD`~~
